#### Database Schema

The database schemas were designed using [Lucid App](https://lucid.app/) These schemas were pivotal in planning the database models and defining their respective fields. They also facilitated visualizing the relationships between the models and their interactions. Recipe comprises four models: Recipe, Profile, User and Comment.

## Agile Development

The project applied Agile Methodology on GitHub for planning and execution. User Stories were established as GitHub issues, outlining their purposes distinctly. Each story contained specific acceptance criteria and tasks, categorized using colored labels such as 'must-have', 'should-have', 'could-have', or 'won't-have' to manage tasks during iterations.

Additionally, 4 Epics were initiated and expanded into 20 User Stories. Each of these stories was also assigned story points based on their complexity.
